A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. 

The content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, as well as a subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout recorded history. 

Dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message. 

The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology.

A series of thoughts, images, and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep.
