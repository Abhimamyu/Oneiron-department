Dreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. 
REM sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep. At times, dreams may occur during other stages of sleep. 
However, these dreams tend to be much less vivid or memorable. The length of a dream can vary. they may last for a few seconds, or 
approximately 20–30 minutes. People are more likely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM phase. The average 
person has three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven. however, most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten.
Dreams tend to last longer as the night progresses. During a full eight-hour night sleep, most dreams occur in the typical two 
hours of REM.
