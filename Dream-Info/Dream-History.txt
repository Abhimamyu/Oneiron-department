# Ancient history

The Dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous Australians for a personal, or group, creation 
and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating.

The Sumerians in Mesopotamia left evidence of dreams dating back to 3100 BC. According to these early recorded stories, gods and 
kings, like the 7th century BC scholar-king Assurbanipal, paid close attention to dreams. In his archive of clay tablets, some 
accounts of the story of the legendary king Gilgamesh were found.

The Mesopotamians believed that the soul, or some part of it, moves out from the body of the sleeping person and actually visits 
the places and persons the dreamer sees in their sleep. Sometimes the god of dreams is said to carry the dreamer. Babylonians and 
Assyrians divided dreams into "good," which were sent by the gods, and "bad," sent by demons – they also believed that their 
dreams were omens and prophecies.

In ancient Egypt, as far back as 2000 BC, the Egyptians wrote down their dreams on papyrus. People with vivid and significant 
dreams were thought blessed and were considered special. Ancient Egyptians believed that dreams were like oracles, bringing 
messages from the gods. They thought that the best way to receive divine revelation was through dreaming and thus they would 
induce (or "incubate") dreams. Egyptians would go to sanctuaries and sleep on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, 
comfort, or healing from the gods.

# Classical history

In Chinese history, people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey 
in a dream realm, while the other remained in the body, although this belief and dream interpretation had been questioned since 
early times, such as by the philosopher Wang Chong (27–97 AD). 

#In Hinduism

The Indian text Upanishads, written between 900 and 500 BC, 
emphasize two meanings of dreams. The first says that dreams are merely expressions of inner desires. The second is the belief of 
the soul leaving the body and being guided until awakened.

The Greeks shared their beliefs with the Egyptians on how to interpret good and bad dreams, and the idea of incubating dreams. 
Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest 
Greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting 
the same way after the divine message was given.

Antiphon wrote the first known Greek book on dreams in the 5th century BC. In that century, other cultures influenced Greeks to 
develop the belief that souls left the sleeping body. 

Hippocrates (469–399 BC) had a simple dream theory, during the day, the soul receives images. during the night, it produces images. Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) believed dreams caused 
physiological activity. He thought dreams could analyze illness and predict diseases. 

Marcus Tullius Cicero, for his part, believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and conversations a dreamer had during the
preceding days. 

Cicero's Somnium Scipionis described a lengthy dream vision, which in turn was commented on by Macrobius in his Commentarii in 
Somnium Scipionis.

In Welsh history, The Dream of Rhonabwy (Welsh: Breuddwyd Rhonabwy) is a Middle Welsh prose tale. Set during the reign of Madogap 
Maredudd, prince of Powys (died 1160), it is dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It survives in only one manuscript, the Red 
Book of Hergest, and has been associated with the Mabinogion since its publication by Lady Charlotte Guest in the 19th century. 
The bulk of the narrative describes a dream vision experienced by its central character, Rhonabwy, a retainer of Madog, in which 
he visits the time of King Arthur.

Also in Welsh history, the tale 'The Dream of Macsen Wledig' is a romanticised story about the Roman emperor Magnus Maximus, called Macsen Wledig in Welsh. Born in Hispania, he became a legionary commander in Britain, assembled a Celtic army and assumed the title of Emperor of the Western Roman Empire in 383. He was defeated in battle in 385 and beheaded at the direction of the Eastern Roman emperor.[23]
In Abrahamic religions

In Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. It is discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55–60.

The ancient Hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion, though the Hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the voice of one God alone. Hebrews also differentiated between good dreams (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). The Hebrews, like many other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive divine revelation. For example, the Hebrew prophet Samuel would "lie down and sleep in the temple at Shiloh before the Ark and receive the word of the Lord." Most of the dreams in the Bible are in the Book of Genesis.[24]

Christians mostly shared the beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that dreams were of a supernatural character because the Old Testament includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most famous of these dream stories was Jacob's dream of a ladder that stretches from Earth to Heaven. Many Christians preach that God can speak to people through their dreams.

Iain R. Edgar has researched the role of dreams in Islam.[25] He has argued that dreams play an important role in the history of Islam and the lives of Muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last prophet, Muhammad.[26]
In Hinduism

In the Mandukya Upanishad, part of the Veda scriptures of Indian Hinduism, a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state.[27]
Dreams and philosophical realism
Main article: Dream argument
A Dream of a Girl Before a Sunrise by Karl Bryullov (1830–1833)

Some philosophers have concluded that what we think of as the "real world" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the 
skeptical hypothesis about ontology).

The first recorded mention of the idea was by Zhuangzi, and it is also discussed in Hinduism, which makes extensive use of the 
argument in its writings. It was formally introduced to Western philosophy by Descartes in the 17th century in his Meditations 
on First Philosophy. Stimulus, usually an auditory one, becomes a part of a dream, eventually then awakening the dreamer.

# Postclassical and medieval history

Some Indigenous American tribes and Mexican civilizations believe that dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their
ancestors. Some Native American tribes used vision quests as a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding 
dream was received, to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their return.

The Middle Ages brought a harsh interpretation of dreams.[citation needed] They were seen as evil, and the images as temptations 
from the devil. Many believed that during sleep, the devil could fill the human mind with corrupting and harmful thoughts. 
Martin Luther, founder of Protestantism, believed dreams were the work of the Devil. However, Catholics such as St. Augustine 
and St. Jerome claimed that the direction of their lives was heavily influenced by their dreams.[citation needed]

# In art

The depiction of dreams in Renaissance and Baroque art is often related to Biblical narrative. Examples are Joachim's Dream 
(1304–1306) from the Scrovegni Chapel fresco cycle by Giotto, and Jacob's Dream (1639) by Jusepe de Ribera. Dreams and dark 
imaginings are the theme of several notable works of the Romantic era, such as Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces 
Monsters (c. 1799) and Henry Fuseli's painting The Nightmare (1781). Salvador Dalí's Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around 
a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening (1944) also investigates this theme through absurd juxtapositions of a nude lady, tigers 
leaping out of a pomegranate, and a spider-like elephant walking in the background. Henri Rousseau's last painting was The Dream.
Le Rêve ("The Dream") is a 1932 painting by Pablo Picasso.

# In literature

Dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory to justify the narrative; The Book of the Duchess and The Vision Concerning
Piers Plowman are two such dream visions. Even before them, in antiquity, the same device had been used by Cicero and Lucian of 
Samosata.
