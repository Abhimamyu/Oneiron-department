# Daydreams

Daydreaming is classified as a level of consciousness between sleep and wakefulness.  Studies show that you have the tendency to 
daydream an average of 70-120 minutes a day. It occurs during waking hours when you let your imagination carry you away. As your 
mind begins to wander and your level of awareness decreases, you lose yourself in your imagined scenario and fantasy.  

# False Awakening Dreams

Have you ever thought you have waken up and gone about your daily morning routine: getting up, brushing your teeth, eating 
breakfast and going to work, only to wake up "again" and realize that what just happened is just a dream. That sensation is 
referred to as a false awakening.

# Lucid Dreams

Lucid dreams occur when you realize you are dreaming. "Wait a second. This is only a dream!" Most dreamers wake themselves up 
once they realize that they are dreaming. Other dreamers have cultivated the skill to remain in the lucid state of dreaming. 
They become an active participant in their own dreams, making decisions in their dreams and influencing the dream's outcome 
without awakening. Get a more in depth look at lucid dreams.

# Nightmares

A nightmare is a disturbing dream that causes you to wake up feeling anxious and frightened. Nightmares may be a response to real
life trauma and situations. These type of nightmares fall under a special category called Post-traumatic Stress Nightmare (PSN). 
Nightmares may also occur because you have ignored or refused to accept a particular life situation. Research shows that most 
people who have regular nightmares have a family history of psychiatric problems, are involved in a rocky relationship or have 
had bad drug experiences. These people may have also contemplated suicide.  Nightmares are an indication of a fear that needs to 
be acknowledged and confronted. It is a way for the subconscious to wake up and take notice. "Pay attention!"  Learn more about 
your nightmares.  

# Recurring Dreams

Recurring dreams repeat themselves with little variation in story or theme.  These dreams may be positive, but most often they 
are nightmarish in content.  Dreams may recur because a conflict depicted in the dream remains unresolved or  ignored. Once you 
find a resolution to the problem, your recurring dreams will cease. Find out more about your recurring dreams.

# Healing Dreams

Healing dreams serve as messages for the dreamer in regards to their health. The Ancient Greeks called these dreams "prodromic". 
Many dream experts believe that dreams can help in avoiding potential health problems and healing when you are ill or when you 
are grieving. Research shows that asthma and migraine sufferers have certain types of dreams before an attack. Your bodies are 
able to communicate to your mind through dreams. The dreams can "tell" you that something is not quite right with your bodies 
even before any physical symptoms show up. Dreams of this nature may be telling the dreamer that he or she needs to go to the 
dentist or doctor. If you can understand the language of dreams, your dreams will serve as an invaluable early warning system. 
They can help inform, advise and heal.

# Prophetic Dreams

Prophetic dreams, also referred to as precognitive or psychic dreams, are dreams that seemingly foretell the future.  One 
rational theory to explain this phenomenon is that your dreaming mind is able to piece together bits of information and 
observation that you may normally overlook or that you do not seriously consider. In other words, your unconscious mind knows 
what is coming before you consciously piece together the same information.

# Signal Dreams

Signal dreams help you how to solve problems or make decisions in your waking life.

# Epic Dreams

Epic dreams (also referred to as Great Dreams, Cosmic Dreams or Numinous Dreams) are so huge, so compelling, and so vivid that 
you cannot ignore them. The details of such dreams remain with you for years, as if you just dreamt it last night. These dreams 
possess much beauty and contain many archetypal symbology.  When you wake up from such a dream, you feel that you have 
discovered something profound or amazing about yourself or about the world. It feels like a life-changing experience.  Learn how 
to recognize an epic dream.  

# Progressive Dreams

Progressive dreams occur when you have a sequence of dreams that continue over a period of nights. The dream continues where you 
left off the previous night. Such dreams are problem-solving dreams and help to explore different options and various approaches 
to a problem, situation or relationship.  

# Mutual Dreams

Mutual dreams are described as such when two people have the same dream. Mutual dreams may be planned, meaning that two people 
actively work toward achieving one dream scenario or goal. It is a way to improve communication and build trust. Mutual dreams 
can also be spontaneous. You find out that a friend, a significant other, faraway relative, or someone has had the same dream on 
the same night as you. Not much study has gone into the phenomenon of mutual dreams, but there is a very strong bond that exist 
between these two people.
