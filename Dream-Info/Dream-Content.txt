From the 1940s to 1985, Calvin S. Hall collected more than 50,000 dream reports at Western Reserve University. In 1966 Hall and 
Van De Castle published The Content Analysis of Dreams, in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from 
college students. Results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream 
content. Hall's complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid-1990s by Hall's protégé William Domhoff.

# Visuals

The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric. that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into 
each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories
and experiences, but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories 
wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to 
the dream.

People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams. Their dream contents are related to other senses like auditory, touch, 
smell and taste, whichever are present since birth.

# Emotions

In the Hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety. Other emotions included abandonment, anger, fear, 
joy, and happiness. Negative emotions were much more common than positive ones.

# Sexual themes

The Hall data analysis shows that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens.
Another study showed that 8% of both men and women's dreams have sexual content. In some cases, sexual dreams may result in orgasms
or nocturnal emissions. These are colloquially known as wet dreams.

# Color vs. black and white

A small minority of people say that they dream only in black and white.[not in citation given] A 2008 study by a researcher at the 
University of Dundee found that people who were only exposed to black and white television and film in childhood reported dreaming 
in black and white about 25% of the time.

# Relationship with medical conditions

There is evidence that certain medical conditions (normally only neurological conditions) can impact dreams. For instance, some 
people with synesthesia have never reported entirely black-and-white dreaming, and often have a difficult time imagining the idea 
of dreaming in only black and white.
