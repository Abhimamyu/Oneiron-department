# Daydreams

Studies reveal that the average person daydreams for a whopping 70-120 minutes of their waking day.

As with all types of dreams, you enter a kind of hypnotic trance and allow your unconscious thoughts to rise to the surface.

During daydreams, you are semi-awake. Clearly not asleep - but not fully checked-in with reality, either.

A daydream starts with a compelling thought, memory or fantasy, and your imagination runs away. The longer you daydream, the 
deeper you becomes immersed in your private fantasy land. 

# Normal Dreams

These are your bog standard dreams where you have no idea you're dreaming until you wake up.

In a typical dream, you could be doing a rap duet with the Pope and think nothing of it. You accept your dream reality as it is.

Everybody has normal dreams every single night. These dreams arise mostly out of REM sleep and are essential to our survival.

In fact, we would eventually die without them. Assuming you get eight hours of shuteye, you will dream for about 100 minutes 
- with longer and more vivid dreams occurring at the end of your sleep.

# Lucid Dreams

Lucid dreams are the best types of dreams, hands down.

They are richly immersive and you can guide them into infinite and beautiful worlds of your choosing. Lucid dreaming is the 
ultimate freedom.

What defines a lucid dream? It's any dream in which, while physically asleep, you also:
  know that you're dreaming; and/or
  can control the dream or direct your awareness

Sometimes I control lots of aspects of the dream - like the locations or characters or plot. But my dreaming mind still fills in 
a lot of details on its own.

Other times I let the dream guide me and show me whatever it wants. I'm still lucid because I can think clearly, acknowledge I'm 
dreaming and experience the dream in real-life intensity.

# Nightmares

In the Western world, nightmares are any normal dreams with a very scary twist.

In nightmares, you don't know you're dreaming. So the unconscious mind processes everything as if it were really happening. Some 
nightmares can be so vivid that the sensory system is triggered and you can feel certain types of pain. It can be very unnerving.

According to dream analysis, being chased in a nightmare represents our evolutionary fear of being hunted.

Children - who arguably feel more vulnerable than most adults - report this type of dream the most. Studies show that nightmares 
are usually caused by sickness, stress, trauma, and drugs or alcohol. 

# False Awakenings 

Ever watched Groundhog Day with Bill Murray?

False awakenings are a bit like that. You wake up as normal and plod into the bathroom, get dressed, eat breakfast, and maybe 
even get half way to work before you realize "oh my god, I'm still dreaming!

And then you wake up.

False awakenings are basically very vivid types of dreams.

Like any normal dream, you assume you're awake, and you certainly don't know you're dreaming (if you do, you're already lucid). 
It begins in your bedroom, or the last place you went to sleep - or even a different bed altogether.
