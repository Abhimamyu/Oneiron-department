# Recurring Dreams
Have you ever had the same dream repeat over and over? These recurring dreams are often indicative of an energetic loop running 
through your life. It's like your system is a big tape recorder and your consciousness is pushing the "playback" button over and 
over again. It is vital to take stock of the symbolism and events in these recurring dreams so that messages can be gleaned from 
the scenes. By identifying and then interpreting these messages, we can get out of the "playback" mode and start moving forward in 
our lives (both in dream life and real life).

# Animal Dreams
More and more people are reporting to have vivid dreams with animals in them. This is a direct message from the animal 
queen/kingdom. When we have these dreams it indicates there may be a need to get in touch with the very basics of life, and become 
more grounded in the simple, natural aspects of living. Animals in our dreams will relay outstanding wisdom to us. This wisdom will
depend on the animal, it's condition, the dream-environment (habitat), among other criteria. Let these animals coach you about the 
meaning of the dream.

# Visitations
Among the various types of dreams, visitation dreams are particularly fascinating as they can offer a wealth of information. 
Visitation dreams are when we are visited by people who are no longer living here with us on the earth plane. Often these dreams 
are from loved ones who have passed - they can tap into us when we are sleeping better as there are fewer distractions. We may also
be visited in our dreams by our spirit guides, and these dreams will be very distinct as very precise information will be conveyed 
to you in the dream. Visitation dreams can also present non-human visits, like animals, or other energies outside the realm of 
human.

# Nightmares:
We've all had them, and we've woken from these dreams breathing a sigh of relief and saying "I'm glad that was just a dream!" 
Although, nightmares are so powerful, and can feel completely real. Nightmares are plugged right into our primal centers and 
activate aspects of ourselves that are typically hidden. These aspects can be our shadow selves and can deal with pain, regret, 
shame, guilt, fear and a whole slew of other nightmarish monsters. Nightmares are actually healthy as they bring these issues to 
the surface. It's like airing out a fresh wound - it needs to breathe to heal. Same way with nightmares. Our consciousness brings 
our fears out in the open in the form of a nightmare so we might begin to consciously heal emotional wounds.

# Prophetic Dreams:
These types of dreams represent prophecy - future events shown in dreams. These dreams will be direct knowing of events that have 
not yet taken place. These dreams can be extremely unsettling - particularly if the events are unfavorable. When this happens, 
it's important to know time is non-linear, meaning events never happen in a straight line. This is comforting, because there are 
infinite potentials that will affect point A (the time of your prophetic dream) and point B (the manifestation of the event you 
dreamed about).
